<p>Jersey born-and-raised and currently living and studying design in Miami, Florida. Talents include layering Prismacolor soft core pencils, tiny hand writing, and spotting bulldogs in public. I enjoy working with my hands, as my creative process always begins with a pen and paper, and sometimes even ends that way.  </p>
